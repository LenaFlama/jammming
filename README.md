In this project, I build a React web application called Jammming. I use my knowledge of React components, passing state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.

Features:

Users can search for songs by song title.
Users can see information about each song like title, artist, and album for songs they queried
Users can export their custom playlist to their personal Spotify account
Displays a list of the current user's playlists
Allows a user to select one of their existing playlists. The application will load the name of that playlist and the tracks of that playlist in the playlist panel.
